# kalmanfilterpy

Linear Kalman filter using data from a RocketPY simulation.  It assumes we are getting data from a GPS every .1 seconds, getting position and velocity in all three axes and deriving acceleration from the velocity change.  It can be just run from main.py and will show all the relevant data in scatter plots.
